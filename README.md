# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project uses K-Means Clustering to segment mall customers based on their demographic and spending patterns. The goal is to help businesses identify distinct customer groups for better targeting and marketing strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Domain**: Retail Analytics / Customer Behavior
- **Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
- [Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)
- Features used:
  - Age
  - Annual Income (k$)
  - Spending Score (1–100)

## 📈 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** – Ensured consistency and handled nulls (if any)
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized patterns and distributions
3. **Feature Selection** – Selected relevant attributes for clustering
4. **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score** – Determined optimal cluster count
5. **Clustering** – Applied K-Means algorithm
6. **Insights** – Interpreted clusters and their marketing potential

## 🧠 Insights Gained
- Identified high-income low-spending clusters indicating untapped market potential.
- Discovered customer groups with high loyalty traits based on spending score.

## 📸 Visualizations
- Pairplots, Elbow curves, Cluster scatter plots.
